# CORSMiddleware is used to enable Cross-Origin Resource Sharing (CORS). This is necessary when your frontend (e.g., React app) is hosted on a different domain or port than your backend (FastAPI) â€” which is very common during development.
# allow_methods
# A list of HTTP methods you want to allow from the frontend.

# Common methods:
# Method	Use case
# "GET"	Fetch data (safe)
# "POST"	Submit data (form, JSON)
# "PUT"	Update data
# "DELETE"	Delete data
# "OPTIONS"	Preflight requests (automatic by browser)
