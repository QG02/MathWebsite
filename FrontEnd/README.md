📘 FrontEnd – MathWebsite
This is the React + TypeScript frontend for the MathWebsite project. The goal of this project is to create a clean, fast, and interactive Algebra 1 practice web app for students and lifelong learners.

✨ Why This Project Exists
As a math tutor and computer science graduate, I was frustrated by existing platforms that were:

  1) Too rigid or bloated for beginner learners

  2) Not responsive or intuitive for simple practice

So I built my own.

🧱 What This Frontend Does
  1) Connects to a FastAPI backend to fetch real-time math problems

  2) Displays one Algebra 1 problem at a time

  3) Accepts user input and gives instant ✅/❌ feedback

  4) Designed to be beginner-friendly
     

🚀 Tech Stack
  1) React (Vite) – Fast dev and build time

  2) TypeScript – Type safety and clarity

  3) CSS – Clean UI, separated in App.css

  4) FastAPI Backend – Serves randomized algebra problems via API (see BackEnd folder)

  5) SymPy (Python) – Symbolic math engine

🛠️ How to Run
  1) Clone the repo:
    ```git clone https://github.com/QG02/MathWebsite.git```
    ```cd MathWebsite/FrontEnd```

  2) Install dependencies:
    ```npm install```
    **NOTICE:** this project was done in a terminal python virtual environment (venv), take into consideration before conitnuing.
      
  3) Start development server:
    ```npm run dev```

🧩 Features in Progress
  1) Topic selection dropdown (e.g., Foundations, Equations, Word Problems)

  2) Mobile responsiveness & accessibility improvements

  3) Auth & user tracking (Firebase)
