# ðŸ§® Algebra 1 Practice App

Welcome to the Algebra 1 Practice App â€” a focused, educational tool built from the ground up to help students sharpen their algebra skills through clean, responsive design and instant feedback.

## ðŸŽ¯ Purpose & Inspiration

This project was born out of personal frustration with existing math education platforms like Pearson MyMathLab and Lyryx. As both a developer and math tutor, I found many of these tools to be overly rigid, frustrating for students, and lacking the simplicity and flexibility that real learning requires.

Rather than continue to work around those limitations, I decided to build a better solution â€” one that starts simple, works well, and grows with both my needs as a tutor and the needs of students.

## ðŸš€ Project Goals

The Algebra 1 Practice App is designed with a few key goals in mind:

- âœ… **Offer students a clean and intuitive interface to practice math problems.**
- âœ… **Provide real-time feedback with no login required (at least for the MVP).**
- âœ… **Enable topic-based practice starting with foundational Algebra 1 topics.**
- âœ… **Use a modern tech stack that is fast, scalable, and easy to maintain.**

Eventually, this app will integrate user accounts, progress tracking, and personalized recommendations â€” but it starts with a single topic and a single problem.

## ðŸ§± Tech Stack

- **Frontend**: React + MathJax
- **Backend**: Python + FastAPI + SymPy
- **Database**: PostgreSQL
- **Auth**: Firebase Authentication (future)
- **Hosting**: Render

## ðŸ“† Development Plan (1-Week Sprints)

1. **Sprint 1** â€“ MVP: Single topic, problem generation, solution input, and feedback system.
2. **Sprint 2** â€“ Add multiple topics and backend routing for each.
3. **Sprint 3** â€“ User authentication and basic progress tracking.
4. **Sprint 4** â€“ Add mobile-friendly design, contact/help page, and error handling.

## ðŸ’¡ Vision

The long-term vision is to develop a modular, customizable math platform that can be used not only for tutoring but also by teachers, homeschoolers, and independent learners. With open-ended design and educator-first thinking, this app will grow into a reliable resource for Algebra 1 and beyond.
